An LLM-driven financial document intelligence system that automates 
earnings report analysis — extracting structured metrics, generating 
analyst-grade narratives, and enabling interactive document exploration 
via multi-turn Q&A.

Built to reduce manual earnings review time and accelerate insight 
generation for financial analysis workflows.

```



\*\*Where to get earnings PDFs:\*\*

\- \[SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar) — search any public company, look for 10-Q/10-K filings

\- Company investor relations pages (e.g. Apple, Microsoft, J\&J, CVS Health)

\- Earnings call transcripts from \[Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/earnings-call-transcripts/) (copy/paste text)

\## Design Decisions



| Choice | Rationale |

|---|---|

 Fast and cost-effective for document extraction tasks |

| Two-pass architecture | Separate structured extraction from narrative generation for cleaner outputs |

| 80K char truncation | Stays safely within context limits while covering most earnings docs |

| Multi-turn Q\&A | Maintains conversation history to support follow-up questions |

| JSON-first extraction | Structured output enables downstream use (dashboards, alerts, comparisons) |



\---



\## Potential Extensions



\- \*\*Batch processing\*\* — run across multiple quarters and track metric trends over time

\- \*\*Comparison mode\*\* — compare two companies' earnings side-by-side

\- \*\*Alerts\*\* — flag when guidance misses consensus by a threshold

\- \*\*Healthcare variant\*\* — adapt extraction schema for clinical trial readouts or hospital earnings (CMS reporting)

\- \*\*Streamlit UI\*\* — drag-and-drop PDF interface with charts
